# hello-world


greetings mortals!

my name is lavythecat and i enjoy many wonderful things now banned from the puny humans!(:
(also, space pizza is nice and did you know that taco cat is taco cat backward!)

##### *On a more serious note...*
This is a collaboration between members of the FRLC Coding Club  
to make hello world programs in a bunch of programming languages!  
People currently working on it:
*  Magdalena Barnas (lavythecat)
*  Ricky LeDew (meltedchocolate)
